First of all, you need to set your release date on whatever digital distributor you use. For example, if you use Distrokid, you can send your song to all the streaming platforms on Day 1 and have your song ready for submission to Spotify Editorial Playlists a few days later (to do this, you\u2019ll have to access your Spotify for Artists account on a desktop computer and find your unreleased song under the \u201cUpcoming\u201d tab). After your release is set up, you can think of your release campaign in two domains. The first is Nurturing: your promotion to those who already follow you. These are the people that will pre-save your song, engage with your Instagram teasers or share the song with their friends. This is because they already believe in you as an artist - they either know you personally, or they follow you because they like your music and content. This group of fans must be nurtured and reinforced for their commitment to your music. Consider running a giveaway to show appreciation, or releasing some content that shouts out your followers in some way. Connecting this content to the release of your new song will help you convert new listeners to fans. The second domain to consider in your release is Outreach. This is the side of your release campaign that will try to broaden your audience and introduce your single to as many potential fans as possible. Submitting to the Spotify Editorial Playlists is one way to do this, but there are many services that are free or budget-friendly to get posted to playlists, blogs and other media sources.

I\u2019ve worked with artists who arrive in my studio with a full team assembled: co-writers, photographer, producer, graphic artist, manager, and so on. Their music almost always comes out sounding more polished and the release campaigns always go smoothly. At the end of the day, however, there is one member of your team that you should value above all: your audio engineer. Having chemistry with your audio engineer is essential because when all is said and done, it is the line of communication between the two of you that will determine how your music comes out. For your part, this means that you must have a clear understanding of what you want, and know how to express it verbally. Here are some basic tips for working with any audio engineer that will make their life easier and reduce the guesswork so that you get the product you\u2019re looking for without spending your precious studio hours going back and forth endlessly "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(8,"p"),e.TgZ(9,"span",5),e._uU(10,"1.

Let\u2019s take a metaphorical example. You\u2019re the artist, and usually you spend a four hour recording session working on three or four different demos, just getting rough ideas out there and taking them home. But today, you have a song that you know is a banger and you want to devote lots of time to getting it just right. If you don\u2019t communicate your plan to the engineer, he or she might assume that this is just any other song. If you get a mediocre take of the main vocal line, they might tell you it\u2019s good enough. They might not bother getting the vocal effects set up just right, since they still think they\u2019re working on a demo. They will value pace over precision, since they might be working off the assumption that there are tons more songs you want to record. In this case, you won\u2019t get the results you want and you might get frustrated and assume your engineer is lazy or incompetent. In reality they are likely trying to anticipate your needs and meet them, but they are working off of incomplete information. So, do your best to communicate the birds\u2019 eye view of your plan for that session. How many songs do you want to work on? Are they finished or do they still need some tweaking? Do you plan on releasing them soon, or just putting them in the vault for a later drop? Knowing the answers to all of these questions will help you immensely, but communicating them out loud will help your engineer even more. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(13,"p"),e.TgZ(14,"span",5),e._uU(15,"2.

Rather than listing off a bunch of terms and definitions, I would rather give you a few concepts to look into on your own time. Specifically, let\u2019s look at one of the most fundamental concepts that your engineer is considering when you\u2019re recording: frequency. Together, frequency and time (plus volume) make up all of music. So what is frequency? One way to think of it is pitch, or how \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 something sounds. When you sing in a deep voice, the vibration of your vocal chords are generating a lot of low frequencies. If you make a squeak, you\u2019re creating more high frequencies. Engineers typically use a plugin called an \u2018equalizer\u2019 to manage frequency ranges. Take a look at the simple equalizer below: "),e._UZ(18,"img",6),e._uU(19," In this example, someone has rolled off (lowered) most of the higher frequencies, and raised up the lower frequencies. The overall sound created by this will be quite muffled and bassy. Your engineer likely won\u2019t be treating your voice in this way. Usually they will make small and barely noticeable dips and boosts at specific frequencies. If you think your voice is too bassy -- or too squeaky, or too nasally -- these descriptions will help your audio engineer determine where they need to cut your voice in the frequency range. This is just one concept out of the many hundreds of ideas that are flying through your audio engineer\u2019s head. To continue to communicate well with them, you will have to take it upon yourself to learn, ask questions, and always be descriptive. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(20,"p"),e.TgZ(21,"span",5),e._uU(22,"3.

In reality, it\u2019s the engineers job to guide you through the session, not the other way around. These tips are intended to provide an outline of how to create a mutual relationship of respect between you and your audio engineer. However, it is still possible that if you extend the effort to communicate clearly and learn the appropriate terms to express your needs, you might not get much in return.

We\u2019ll dive into those below, but first I\u2019d like to address one common pitfall that plagues artists of all styles and genres: the friend with a studio. Almost every artist hits this stage of their development, where they are courted by a friend with a fledgling studio and the promise of free or inexpensive recording time. Now it is important to note that most studios these days start as small, home-based operations, and there are lots of very talented engineers working independently out of their home studios. However, if you are going to work with a friend, be sure that your lines of communication are open. It\u2019s crucial that both parties understand the pricing and time involved, and that either party can discontinue their relationship and look elsewhere without feelings being hurt. It can be a great experience to begin recording with a buddy who has a microphone and a copy of Ableton Live or FL Studio. However, as an artist you must understand that as you mature and develop your craft, you will eventually need to outgrow this environment and start budgeting for a professional studio. With that said, here are the three most important criteria for finding yourself a good fit when looking for a studio: "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(11,"p"),e.TgZ(12,"span",6),e._uU(13,"Genre-Appropriateness:"),e.qZA(),e._UZ(14,"br"),e._uU(15," There are a million studios out there for you to choose from, and they will all tell you that they are the perfect fit for your music. If you are only recording vocals, your money will likely be wasted by booking an expensive studio equipped with drum kits, guitar amps, and racks of outboard gear. This equipment is inherent in the hourly price of the studio, and won\u2019t bring you any benefit. A smaller vocal studio that specializes in the same genres you like will get you much further for a lower price tag. While the big fancy studio with leather couches on the live floor and guitars all over the wall might feel like a flex, it\u2019s really not necessary unless you are recording a full band. What\u2019s worse, a studio that specializes in recording rock or metal might have limited experience with the techniques needed to make a popular rap anthem. When you find a studio, check their website and their Instagram to see what kind of artists record there. If they don\u2019t resemble your style of music at all, keep looking. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(16,"p"),e.TgZ(17,"span",6),e._uU(18,"Sound Quality:"),e.qZA(),e._UZ(19,"br"),e._uU(20," This one is pretty simple. Most studios sound good, but make sure to do your homework and check out some of their portfolio. The best thing to do is find a decent set of speakers (e.g. NOT your phone or laptop speakers) to listen to some of their work and make sure it sounds appropriate. If the vocals sound too quiet, unclear, washed out, or out of time, look elsewhere. Don\u2019t forget, every studio makes songs that don\u2019t sound good. Not every song should see the light of day. But the songs they choose to put out on their platforms should reflect the very best that they have to offer.

If you\u2019re a rapper on a budget, you may already realize that the biggest determining factor in your studio choice will be the hourly price for recording. For some, price is not as much of a factor. Regardless, you should pick a price range that reflects your commitment to succeeding as an artist. In order to grow, you should make the recording studio a part of your weekly routine. If you can budget a few hundred dollars a month for your music, booking two hour sessions every week will help you develop the all-important cycle of constantly writing and recording new material. Considering these factors, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find a studio that is a good fit for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to try out a couple studios and shop around, there\u2019s no obligation. Additionally, make sure that you can work well with the staff there. It\u2019s not just about equipment and price -- at the end of the day, it is the people running the studio that will determine the fate of your song.
